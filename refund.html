      <p>
        Thank you for purchasing from Vital Vigor. We hope you love our product, but we understand that
        sometimes things don’t work out. This Refund Policy outlines how you can request a refund
        if you’re not fully satisfied.
      </p>

      <h2>Refund Period</h2>
      <p>
        After your purchase, you have 180 days from the moment your order is delivered to you
        to request a refund. If you are not fully satisfied with your investment, you can
        easily ask for your money back.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> We encourage all our customers to use Vital Vigor for at least 3 months
        to experience its potential benefits before reaching a conclusion. However, we respect your decision
        if you wish to request a refund earlier.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Request a Refund</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Make sure you are still within the 180-day period starting from the day the product was
          delivered to you. If you need to verify the delivery date, please check the tracking information
          provided by the carrier.
        </li>
        <li>
          Send an email to our support team at
          <a href="mailto:support@vitalvigor.com">contactus@getvitalvigor.com</a> with the
          subject line “Refund Request,” clearly stating that you are requesting a refund.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once your Refund Request is reviewed and approved, our support team will provide instructions
          on how to return the empty or unused product bottles. The return address is:
          <br><br>

        </li>
        <li>
          All shipping costs for returning the products are the responsibility of the customer. We will
          initiate the refund as soon as we receive and verify the returned bottles.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h2>Processing Time</h2>
      <p>
        Once we receive your returned items, we will inspect them to ensure eligibility. If approved,
        refunds typically take between 5–10 business days to be credited back to your original payment
        method, depending on your financial institution.
